# ContiNew

### Organizational Introduction
The slogan of the ContiNew (Continue New) series project: Continuously iterate and optimize, continuously provide out-of-the-box, comfortable development experience. Relying on the open-source collaboration model, it enhances technical transparency, magnifies collective wisdom, and co-creates excellent practices.

We always believe that a good product is inevitably polished repeatedly. However, in our work, we are limited by factors such as customer needs and development cycles, and cannot deeply polish or refactor our code, which is also the root cause of architectural decay. Therefore, we hope to continuously refine a good product, a good practice, a good ecosystem in our spare time through the power of time and the open-source community.

Our vision is that when you apply it to work, you not only get improved efficiency but also a comfortable development experience, making the programming work of more developers a bit ‚Äúsweeter.‚Äù

It is far from perfect right now, but will improve rapidly.
